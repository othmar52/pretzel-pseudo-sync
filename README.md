# pretzel-pseudo-sync
tryout to sync multiple pretzel-boards (Arduino) over WLAN

Based on https://iot.fkainka.de/en/wifi-udp-y-netzwerk-aus-drei-pretzelboards-und-einem-laptop here is an approach to have a host-board and 4 client-boards, where each clients always knows which milliscond is on host's timeline.  

**NOTE:** this is a kinda dirty/sluggish approach but it seems to fit my needs for a MIDI clock based project
